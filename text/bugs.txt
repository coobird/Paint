1. Resize concurrent not working
-> 	Look at the ImageFilterThreadingWrapper to see if that's the problem.
->	Size not changing, and drawn in wrong places.

Note on 03-11-2009
==================
->	Problem is with inability to change the resulting image's size.
	The change in size is not known to the Wrapper, so it cannot deal with
	the change of the image before and after.

->	This is going to be a limitation of the ImageFilterThreadingWrapper.
	It will not allow filters which change the size of the resulting image
	to utilize this facility.

2. Crash when rendering Canvas with shifted layer.
->	Must be a problem with ClippedImageRenderer
->	Crash occurs when portion of BufferedImage beyond the size of layer is
	requested to be drawn. (Exception thrown saying that y + dy > height)

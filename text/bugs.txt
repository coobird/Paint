Bugs

1. Resize concurrent not working
-> look at the ImageFilterThreadingWrapper to see if that's the problem.
-> Size not changing, and drawn in wrong places.

2. Crash when rendering Canvas with shifted layer.
-> Must be a problem with ClippedImageRenderer
-> Crash occurs when portion of BufferedImage beyond the size of layer is
requested to be drawn. (Exception thrown saying that y + dy > height)

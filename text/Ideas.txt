     Paint Ideas
=====================

Image filters
-------------

BufferedImage -> | Filter | -> BufferedImage



How it works
------------

( Canvas ) => BufferedImage -> | ImageRenderer | -> BufferedImage ->
	| Filter | -> BufferedImage (result)
	
Take an image from Canvas, give it to ImageRenderer, which returns BufferedImage
That is given to the Filter which returns BufferedImage


Other Thoughts
--------------

* Think about multiple instances of Canvas

* Allow multiple threads to render single/multiple images at once.
(Think about concurrency)

-> batch processing support
-> command line?
-> scripting?
-> Dont assume single-thread app!!

*@Undo
-> from mousePress to mouseRelease, store the movements and action of
mouse so it can be undo/redo later
-> store the name of brush and positions
-> Store the BrushEvents between DRAW and RELEASE and store it
---> Store current Canvas on RELEASE
---> Then, store the bundles of BrushEvents?

Filters
-------
-> Allow scripting engine to interactively test out filters.
-> Or, have a matrix screen to test out filters.


Layers
------
-> Allow multiple move of layers.

Drawing
-------
Depending on the selected tool, swap out the MouseListener
for the panel that the drawing processing occurs on --> simplify things

*done* Todo: Eraser!!

*done* Request a brush draw through a BrushController
-> do not directly draw by using Graphics context
-> place requests in a queue, and render one-by-one

Request a rendering of the screen through CanvasView
-> do not directly invoke Canvas.render
-> add a zoom functionality to either Canvas or CanvasView
-> the CanvasView will send a rectangle region of image to show with appropriate
magnification.

-> Magnification via Graphics2D.scale

-> Stroke Rendering using Shape
---> PathIterator and using that to drawImage of brush onto the stroke defined
as a Shape.
-> BrushController will take in drawBrush events and append line segments
(optionally curved) into a Shape.
-> Shape segments can be fed to Undo system.
-> See "stroke-render.png" -- render the brush onto shape (coordinates returned
from iterating over using PathIterator) with the brush rotated to be
perpendicular to the stroke shape.


File format
-----------
-> Need a way to store location, name and other attributes of ImageLayer.
-> is serializing going to work?
-> have thumbnail as one of zip entries in image file.

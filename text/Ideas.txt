     Paint Ideas
=====================

Image filters
-------------

BufferedImage -> | Filter | -> BufferedImage



How it works
------------

( Canvas ) => BufferedImage -> | ImageRenderer | -> BufferedImage ->
	| Filter | -> BufferedImage (result)
	
Take an image from Canvas, give it to ImageRenderer, which returns BufferedImage
That is given to the Filter which returns BufferedImage


Other Thoughts
--------------

* Think about multiple instances of Canvas

* Allow multiple threads to render single/multiple images at once.
(Think about concurrency)

-> batch processing support
-> command line?
-> scripting?
-> Dont assume single-thread app!!

*@Undo
-> from mousePress to mouseRelease, store the movements and action of
mouse so it can be undo/redo later
-> store the name of brush and positions

     Paint Ideas
=====================

Image filters
-------------

BufferedImage -> | Filter | -> BufferedImage



How it works
------------

( Canvas ) => BufferedImage -> | ImageRenderer | -> BufferedImage ->
	| Filter | -> BufferedImage (result)
	
Take an image from Canvas, give it to ImageRenderer, which returns BufferedImage
That is given to the Filter which returns BufferedImage


Other Thoughts
--------------

* Think about multiple instances of Canvas

* Allow multiple threads to render single/multiple images at once.
(Think about concurrency)

-> batch processing support
-> command line?
-> scripting?
-> Dont assume single-thread app!!

*@Undo
-> from mousePress to mouseRelease, store the movements and action of
mouse so it can be undo/redo later
-> store the name of brush and positions
-> Store the BrushEvents between DRAW and RELEASE and store it
---> Store current Canvas on RELEASE
---> Then, store the bundles of BrushEvents?

Filters
-------
-> Allow scripting engine to interactively test out filters.
-> Or, have a matrix screen to test out filters.


Layers
------
-> Allow multiple move of layers.
-> Allow merge of layers
-> Merge visible, Merge down/up

-> Text Layers! --> Refactor?
ImageLayer/TextLayer <- Layer ?


Selection
---------
-> ImageLayer takes care of *clipping* while selecting -
---> Graphics context will get setClip to a shape of selection
-> Have the ImageLayerCellRenderer indicate that selection is in place
-> Allow selection and fill paint, etc.

Drawing
-------
Depending on the selected tool, swap out the MouseListener
for the panel that the drawing processing occurs on --> simplify things

*done* Todo: Eraser!!

*done* Request a brush draw through a BrushController
-> do not directly draw by using Graphics context
-> place requests in a queue, and render one-by-one

Request a rendering of the screen through CanvasView
-> do not directly invoke Canvas.render
-> add a zoom functionality to either Canvas or CanvasView
-> the CanvasView will send a rectangle region of image to show with appropriate
magnification.

-> Magnification via Graphics2D.scale

-> Stroke Rendering using Shape
---> PathIterator and using that to drawImage of brush onto the stroke defined
as a Shape.
-> BrushController will take in drawBrush events and append line segments
(optionally curved) into a Shape.
-> Shape segments can be fed to Undo system.
-> See "stroke-render.png" -- render the brush onto shape (coordinates returned
from iterating over using PathIterator) with the brush rotated to be
perpendicular to the stroke shape.

-> Rotate the canvas
--> draw with the canvas rotated; one wouldnt want to draw with the canvas
    aligned all the time, right? 

Text Rendering
--------------
-> Add text rendering --> TextLayer?
-> implement as selection with stroke?

File format
-----------
-> Need a way to store location, name and other attributes of ImageLayer.
-> is serializing going to work?
-> have thumbnail as one of zip entries in image file.
*done*	Temporarily implemented native I/O to serialize ImageLayer.

-> Custom FileFilter that returns extensions
---> use for autofilling extension
---> FormatManager should be able to find the ImageInput/Output from the 
        FileFilter being specified (reverse lookup for use in saving file)


Canvas problems
---------------
need a way to allow selecting enabling of:
* drawing background
* drawing pixel grid
-> both must be able to be set independently, at different times
=> How to implement ImageRenderer? Should move to abstract class from interface?
     -> what about PartialImageRenderer? interface?
     -> keep both as interfaces?
     -> abstract class that implements ImageFilter?
     -> ImageFilter interface has "setDrawBackground" type methods?
     -> Using interface allows for the ImageRenderer to be a subclass of some
     	other class, which comes in handy. 

Unit tests
----------
Write unit tests.

1. Filters
-> create File objects to see if the supports(File) method works.


Error handling
--------------
Error output should be moved from System.out to another mechanism.
Logging? (Probably too heavy)


Concurrency issue
-----------------
Any changes to Swing components should occur in the EDT!
-> Including any action which affects *any* Swing component.


New Layers
----------
TextLayer -> ImageLayer
ReferenceLayer -> ImageLayer
->	References another image. (Load the image on request, not each draw)
->	Each these new layers will store a BufferedImage to use for rendering.

Printing
--------
Printing support should be added.
Was this Graphics2D? Or just awt?
Perhaps overhaul the image I/O system to handle printing as well as file output?

Cancellable Effects
-------------------
Effects and image filters should be cancellable
Make task-based. Use java.util.concurrent -> Callable? (support cancel())

Viewer in a Jar
---------------
Create a JAR file encapsulating the image and viewer.
Don't need editing features.


** Make a Panel (View of MVC) so that can be embedded for picture display!

Brush interface
---------------
Have a brush be a function which draws onto a canvas

e.g.

brush.location(canvas, location, [vector: angle/magnitude], other info?)

Kinda a functional way of looking at brushes.
By default, no state for brushes, so it can be re-made using just the brush
locations --> easier to undo

This would need rethinking of Canvas display (view) structuring -->
how to send location information to the brush.


Variable-intensity Selection
----------------------------
Using a gradient to apply an effect
Have a "Selection Layer", which is a map of "selection intensity"

Map percentage on "selection layer" and apply the effect onto the target layer
with selection

[Selection Layer] + [Effected Target Layer] -> [Actual Result on Layer]

ex. pixel: (255, 255, 255) + effected pixel: (0,0,0) -> Result: (128,128,128)


User interface (UI)
-------------------
* Tab-based
* Allow user to save current state before leaving
-> This will allow the user to return to the state they were working at, such
   as open tabs, current brush settings, etc.
=> Need to figure out a way to serialize all the settings of the UI.
